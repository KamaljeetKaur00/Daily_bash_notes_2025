## Introduction to Git and Version Control:

### What is Git and Why Use Version Control

* **Git** is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code during software development.
* It helps manage code across multiple versions, developers, and updates.
* **Version control** allows:

  * Tracking changes over time
  * Restoring previous versions of files
  * Collaboration among multiple developers without conflicts
  * Safe experimentation with new features

### Git Architecture

**1. Repository (Repo)**

* A **storage area** where Git tracks all file changes
* Can be:

  * **Local**: on your computer
  * **Remote**: on platforms like GitHub, GitLab

**2. Working Tree**

* The actual files and directories you're currently working on in your system
* Reflects the current state of your code
* You make changes in the working tree before committing them

**3. Index (Staging Area)

* A **temporary area** where you add files before committing to the repo
* It allows you to prepare exactly what will go into the next commit
* Acts as a buffer between the working directory and the repository
