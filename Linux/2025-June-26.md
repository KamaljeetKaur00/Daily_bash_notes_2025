## Introduction to Linux Shell and basic commands:
### Kernel:
- The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.
- Think of it as as Chef working in a hotel. You as a coustmer can't see the chef working but get your order (output).

### Shell:
- Shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services.
- Using the same scenario, think of shell as a waiter, who takes your order (input) and gives it to the chef (Kernel).

Shell is divided into two categories-
1. Command Line Shell:

- CSH (C SHell)
- KSH (Korn SHell)
